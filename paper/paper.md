 In the mobile and wireless network domain there are a lot of simulations and domain tools that are required to be produce results of an experiment. Our approach is to minimize the amount of time spent to set up experiments and assumptions for experiments and be able to reproduce experiments with available tools for any user to conduct an experiment on their own environment with no clashing dependencies. Using Popper, a convention and CLI tool, and Docker, a container image, allows any user to reproduce experiments from their peers or a research paper with the exact parameters and assumptions has the author made. This allows for easy replication and reproducibility.


# Introduction


# Methodology

## Popper

## Docker
In order to achieve a reproducibility model for experiments so that an experiment can truly run on any personal machine the technology tool called Docker is used to accomplish this goal. Docker, a technology container, creates an environment which packages an application with all of the application's dependencies. In the experiment, which is further explained [in section], this tool is used the experiment needs Java and Python installed on a machine in order for the whole experiment to run properly. Normally, one would have to make sure that both of these dependencies are installed on one's personal machine, however with the use of Docker an environment is created with those dependencies 


This enables the portability of an experiment which further helps achieve reproducibility. 
  

## Contiki


## Cooja
For the experiment, to be described in the next section, uses Cooja to conduct the main experiment. Cooja is a network simulator that is used in wireless sensor networks which allows to simulate small or large networks.

# Example

## Background

## Pipeline
Figure X shows the pipeline for the this experiment and all of the 

  * .popper.yaml
    This file consists the ordering in which popper executes the main scripts; setup.sh, run.sh, post-run.sh to run the entire experiment with out extra input.

  * .git
    Currently the full experiment is not on Git, which it will be soon, however having the whole pipeline on Git will achieve the portable and reproducibility goal. Any user will be able to clone the repository and be able to reproduce the experiment with out having to individually download dependecies.

  * setup.sh
    The 2.5D Terrain experiment requires Java and the scripts require Python in order to run so by using Docker a container is built and run with the propper libraries and environment.

  * run.sh
    The run script will run the simulations in the environment that's been previously defined in the setup script.

  * sim_config.yaml
    The simulation configration file allows the user to run multiple experiments with different values for the parameters. The parameters that the user can define are the filename, decide to use a random generator true/false for nodes placement, random seed, and number of nodes (maximum of 50). The filename is used to name the different experiments so when looking at the final output it will be evident which experiment produce certain results. As of right now the algorithm has hard coded values for the initial placement of the nodes, but as the experiment is further developed the random generator will radomly generator the node placement. [Add in about random seed and point of that] The user can also define the amount of nodes desired for the experiment with a maximum of 50 nodes, since that is the maximum the algorithm of the experiment can handle.

  * sim_template.csc
    The template file consists of how the simulator reads in script to create the simulations based on the defined parameters for each experiment.

  * create_sim_files.py
    For the N amount of simulations defined in the sim_config.yaml, this file will merge the parameters with the template to create N amount of simlations.

  * simulations directory
    This directory contains all of the simulation files that were produced from create_sim_files.py which will are then run in run.sh

  * output directory
    This directory contains the output for each of the simulations containing the final visability value between the nodes [Need better wording and explain that a bit more]

  * contiki/tools/cooja
    In this directory path, the main experiment with the Java files are in here since Cooja is the simulation tool used for the experiment and actual experiment is run. 
    

Quality assurance (QA) is an essential activity in the software 
engineering process [@myers_art_2011 ; @bertolino_software_2007 ; 
@beizer_software_1990]. Part of the QA pipeline involves the execution 
of performance regression tests, where the performance of the 
application is measured and contrasted against past versions 
[@dean_tail_2013 ; @gregg_systems_2013 ; @vokolos_performance_1998]. 
Examples of metrics used in regression testing are throughput, 
latency, or resource utilization over time. These metrics are captured 
and compared for multiple versions of an application (usually current 
and past versions) and, if significant differences are found, this 
constitutes a regression.

![_quiho_'s workflow for generating inferred resource utilization profiles (IRUPs) for an application. An IRUP is used as an alternative for 
profiling application performance and can complement automated 
regression testing. For example, after a change in the runtime of an application has been detected across two revisions of the code base, an IRUP can be obtained in order to determine whether this change is significant. IRUPs can also aid in root cause analysis.
](figures/irup-generation.pdf){#fig:irup-generation}

One of the main challenges in automating performance regression tests 
is defining the criteria to decide whether a change in 
application performance behavior is significant 
[@cherkasova_anomaly_2008]. Understanding the impact that distinct 
hardware and low-level system software[^system] components have on 
the performance of applications demands highly-skilled performance engineering 
[@jin_understanding_2012 ; @han_performance_2012 ; @jovic_catch_2011]. 
Traditionally, this investigation is done by an analyst in charge of 
looking at changes to the performance metrics captured at runtime, 
possibly investigating deeply by looking at performance counters, 
performance profiles, static code analysis, and static/dynamic 
tracing. One common approach is to find bottlenecks by generating a 
profile (e.g., using the `perf` Linux kernel tool) in order to 
understand which parts of the system an application is hammering on 
[@gregg_systems_2013]. Profiling involves recording resource 
utilization for an application over time. In general, this can be done in two ways: timed- and 
event-based profiles. Timed-based profiling samples the instruction 
pointer at regular intervals and generates a function call tree with 
each node having a percentage of time associated with it, 
which represents the amount of time that the CPU spends within that 
piece of code. Event-based profiling samples at regular intervals 
different events at the hardware- and OS-level in order to obtain a 
distribution of events over time. In 
either case, the system needs to execute the application in a 
"profiling" mode in order to enable the instrumentation 
mechanisms that the OS has available for carrying out this task.

Automated solutions have been proposed in recent years 
[@jiang_automated_2010 ; @shang_automated_2015 ; 
@heger_automated_2013]. The general approach of these is to analyze 
runtime logs and/or metrics 
application in order to build a performance prediction model that can 
be used to automatically determine whether a regression has occurred. 
This relies on having accurate predictions and, as with any prediction 
model, there is the risk of finding false negatives/positives. In addition to
striving for highly accurate predictions, one can also use performance 
modeling as a profiling tool.

In this work we present _quiho_, an approach aimed at complementing 
automated performance regression testing by using inferred 
resource utilization profiles (IRUP) associated to an application. 
_quiho_ is 
an alternative framework for profiling an application where the utilization 
of one or more subsystems (e.g. virtual memory) is inferred by 
applying Statistical Regression Analysis[^sra] (SRA) on 
a dataset of application-independent performance vectors. 
The main 
assumption behind _quiho_ is the availability of multiple machines 
when exercising performance regression testing, a reasonable 
requirement that is well-aligned with current software engineering 
practices (performance regression is carried out on multiple 
architectures and OSs).

When an application is profiled using _quiho_ (@Fig:irup-generation), the machines available to the performance tests are 
baselined by executing a battery of microbenchmarks on each. This matrix 
of performance vectors characterizes the available machines 
independently from any application and can be used (and re-used) as 
the foundation for applying statistical learning techniques such as 
SRA. In order to infer resource utilization, the application under study is 
executed on the same machines from where the performance vectors where 
obtained, and SRA is applied. The result of the SRA for an 
application, in particular feature importance, is used as a proxy to 
characterize hardware and low-level system utilization behavior. The 
relative importance of these features constitutes what we refer to as 
an _inferred resource utilization profile_ (IRUP).

In this article, we demonstrate that our approach successfully 
identifies performance regressions by showing that _quiho_ (1) obtains 
resource utilization profiles for applications that accurately reflect 
what their code do and (2) effectively uses these profiles to identify 
induced regressions as well as other regressions found in real-world 
applications. The contributions of our work are:

  * Insight: feature importance in SRA models (trained using application-independent 
    performance vectors) gives us a resource utilization profile (an IRUP) of an 
    application without having to look at the code.

  * An automated end-to-end framework (based on the above finding), 
    that aids analysts in identifying significant changes in resource 
    utilization behavior of applications which can also aid in 
    identifying root cause of regressions, and that is resilient to 
    code refactoring.

  * Methodology for evaluating automated performance regression. We 
    introduce a set of synthetic benchmarks aimed at evaluating 
    automated regression testing without the need of real bug 
    repositories. These benchmarks take as input parameters that 
    determine their performance behavior, thus simulating different 
    "versions" of an application.

Next section (@Sec:intuition) shows the intuition behind _quiho_ and 
how can be used to automate regression tests. We then do a more 
in-depth description of _quiho_ (@Sec:quiho), followed by our 
evaluation of this approach (@Sec:eval). We then 
discuss different aspects of our work (@Sec:discussion), review 
(@Sec:sra) related work and we lastly close with a brief discussion on 
challenges and opportunities enabled by _quiho_ (@Sec:conclusion).

[^system]: Throughout this paper, we use "system" to refer to the 
low-level compute stack composed by hardware, firmware and the 
operating system (OS).
[^name]: The word _quiho_ means "to discover" or "to find" in Seri, 
the dialect of a native tribe of the same name from Northwestern 
Mexico.

differentiate between regression testing in software engineering and 
regression analysis in statistics.

# Motivation and Intuition {#sec:intuition}

![Automated regression testing pipeline integrating inferred resource 
utilization profiles (IRUP). IRUPs are obtained by _quiho_ and can be 
used both, for identifying regressions, and to aid in the quest for 
finding the root cause of a regression.
](figures/pipeline.pdf){#fig:pipeline}

@Fig:pipeline shows the workflow of an automated regression testing 
pipeline and shows how _quiho_ fits in this picture. A regression is 
usually the result of observing a significant change in a performance 
metric of interest (e.g., runtime). At this point, an analyst will 
investigate further in order to find the root cause of the problem. 
One of these activities involves profiling an application to see the 
resource utilization pattern. Traditionally, coarse-grained profiling 
(i.e. CPU-, memory- or IO-bound) can be obtained by monitoring an 
application's resource utilization over time. Fine granularity 
behavior helps application developers and performance engineers 
quickly understand what they need to focus on while refactoring an 
application.

Fine granularity performance utilization behavior can better inform 
the regression testing pipeline. Examples of which resources are 
included in this type of profiling are the OS memory mapping 
subsystem, the CPU's cryptographic unit, or the CPU cache. This type 
of profiling is time-consuming and requires use of more computing 
resources. This is usually done offline by analysts and involves 
eyeballing source code, static code analysis, or analyzing hardware/OS 
performance counters/profiles.

An alternative is to infer resource utilization behavior by comparing 
the performance of an application on platforms with different 
performance characteristics. For example, if we know that machine A 
has higher memory bandwidth than machine B, and an application is 
memory-bound, then this application will perform better on machine A. 
There are several challenges with this approach:

![A matrix of performance feature vectors over a colection of CloudLab 
servers (left), and an array of a performance metric for an 
application on those same machines (right). Every column in the matrix 
comes from executing a microbenchmark on that machine. This dataset of 
microbenchmarks allows us to create a performance prediction model for 
application. Variability patterns of an application (zlog in the 
example), resemble the same variability pattern of one or more 
performance microbenchmark(s). Thus, the system subcomponent exercised 
by the microbenchmark is likely to be also the cause of why the 
application exhibits such performance behavior.
](figures/featureimportance-implies-bottleneck.pdf){#fig:featureimportance-implies-bottleneck}

 1. Consistent Software. We need to ensure that the software stack is 
    the same on all machines where the application runs.
 2. Application Testing Overhead. The amount of effort required to run 
    applications on a multitude of platforms is not negligible.
 3. Hardware Performance Characterization. It is difficult to obtain 
    the performance characteristics of a machine by just looking at 
    the hardware specs. Therefore, another more practical alternative 
    is required.
 4. Correlating Performance. Even if we could solve the above issue 
    (Hardware Performance Characterization) and infer performance 
    characteristics by just looking at the machine hardware 
    specifications, there is still the problem of not being able to 
    correlate baseline performance with application behavior. The 
    problem is that between two platforms, it is rarely the case that 
    the performance change is observed in only one subcomponent of the 
    system. For example, a newer machine doesn’t have just faster 
    memory sticks, but also a better CPU and chipset.

![An example profile showing the relative importance of features for 
an execution of the `hpccg` miniapp [@heroux_hpccg_2007]. The x-axis 
corresponds to the relative performance value, normalized with respect 
to the most important feature, which corresponds to the first one on 
the y-axis (from top to bottom). @Sec:feature-importance describes in 
detail how feature importances are calculated.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/hpccg.pdf){#fig:hpccg-irup}

The advent of cloud computing allows us to solve (1) using solutions 
like KVM [@kivity_kvm_2007] or software containers 
[@merkel_docker_2014]. ChameleonCloud [@mambretti_next_2015], CloudLab 
[@hibler_largescale_2008 ; @ricci_introducing_2014] and Grid5000 
[@bolze_grid5000_2006] are examples of bare-metal-as-a-service 
infrastructure available to researchers that can be used to automate 
regression testing pipelines for the purposes of investigating new 
approaches. These solutions to infrastructure automation coupled with 
DevOps practices [@wiggins_twelvefactor_2011 ; @huttermann_devops_2012] 
allows us to address (2), i.e. to reduce the amount of work required to 
run tests.

Thus, the main challenge to inferring resource utilization patterns 
lies in quantifying the performance of the platform in a consistent 
way (3,4). One alternative is to look at the hardware specification 
and infer performance characteristics from this, a highly inaccurate 
task due to the lack of correspondence between advertised (or 
theoretical peak throughput) and actual performance observed in 
reality. For example, the platform spec might specify that the machine 
has DDR4 memory sticks with a theoretical peak throughput of 10 GB/s. 
But the actual memory bandwidth is typically less in practice. How 
much less is non-deterministic and depends on access patterns.

_quiho_ solves this problem by characterizing machine performance 
using microbenchmarks. These performance vectors are the "fingerprint" 
that characterizes the behavior of a machine 
[@jimenez_characterizing_2016a]. These vectors, obtained 
over a sufficiently large set of machines[^how-big], can serve as the 
foundation for building a prediction model of the performance of an 
application when executed on new ("unseen") machines 
[@boyse_straightforward_1975]. Thus, a natural next step to take with 
a dataset like this is to try to build a prediction model.

While building a prediction model is obviously something that can be 
used to estimate the performance of an application, building one can 
also serve as a way of identifying resource utilization. If we use 
these performance vectors to apply SRA and focus on feature 
importance [@kira_practical_1992] of the generated models, 
they can allow us to infer resource utilization patterns. In 
@Fig:featureimportance-implies-bottleneck, we show the intuition 
behind why this is so. The performance of an application is determined 
by the performance of the subcomponents that get stressed the most by 
the application's code. Thus, intuitively, if the performance of an 
application across multiple machines resembles the performance of a 
microbenchmark over the same set of machines, then we can say that the application is heavily 
influenced by that subcomponent. In other words, if the variability 
of a feature across multiple machines resembles the 
variability of application performance across those same 
machines, it is likely due to the application stressing the same 
subcomponent that the corresponding microbenchmark stresses. While 
this can be inferred by obtaining correlation coefficients, proper SRA 
is needed in order to create prediction models, as well as to obtain a 
relative rank of feature importances.

Relying on SRA as a way of inferring resource utilization behavior has 
the practical consequence of _quiho_ benefiting heavily from an 
heterogeneous setup. The more the "performance diversity" of machines 
that are available for testing, the easier that _quiho_ can discover 
an application's resource utilization behavior. Intuitively, this can 
be explained as follows. If we run a IO-bound application on distinct 
machines with very different CPU and memory subsystem performance but 
similar IO throughput, we won't be able to discover that the 
application's bottleneck is on the IO subsystem. If we create a more 
heterogeneous mix of machines, with larger IO performance variability, 
we can discover that this application is IO-intensive since the 
performance of the application will vary, depending on the 
capabilities of the underlying IO subsystem of each distinct machine.

[^how-big]: In @Sec:discussion we briefly sketch how we would apply 
PAC to find the minimal set of machines needed to obtaining meaningful 
results from SRA.

Thus, having high performance variability allows _quiho_ to infer 
resource utilization patterns by discovering the underlying 
correlations between the performance of microbenchmarks and an 
application's performance. Since SRA results in creating a performance 
prediction model for an application, we can rank features by sorting 
them with respect to their relative performance prediction importance. 
We call this ranking an _Inferred Resource Utilization Profile_ (IRUP), 
as shown in @Fig:hpccg-irup. In the next section we explain how these 
IRUPs are obtained and how they can be used in automated performance 
regression tests. @Sec:eval empirically validates this approach.

# Our Approach {#sec:quiho}

In this section we describe _quiho_'s approach and the resulting 
prototype. We first describe how we obtain the performance vectors 
that characterize system performance. We then show that we can feed 
these vectors to SRA in order to build a performance model for an 
application. Lastly, we describe how we obtain feature importance, how 
this represents an inferred resource utilization profile 
(IRUP) and the algorithm (and alternative heuristics) to comparing 
IRUPs.

## Performance Feature Vectors As System Performance Characterization

While the hardware and software specification can serve to describe 
the performance characteristics of a machine, the real performance 
characteristics can only feasibly be obtained by executing programs 
and capturing metrics. One can generate arbitrary performance 
characteristics by interposing a hardware emulation layer and 
deterministically associate performance characteristics to each 
instruction based on specific hardware specs. While possible, this is 
impractical (we are interested in characterizing "real" performance). 
The question then boils down to which programs should we use to 
characterize performance? Ideally, we would like to have many programs 
that execute every possible opcode mix so that we measure their 
performance. Since this is an impractical solution, an alternative is 
to create synthetic microbenchmarks that get as close as possible to 
exercising all the available features of a system.

assigned to them by \texttt{stress-ng}. Note that some stressors are 
part of multiple categories.
\label{tbl:stressng-categories}
}
\footnotesize
\input{figures/stressng-categories.tex}
\end{table}

`stress-ng`[@king_stressng_2017] is a tool that is used to "stress 
test a computer system in various selectable ways. It was designed to 
exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well as the 
various operating system kernel interfaces". There are multiple 
stressors for CPU, CPU cache, memory, OS, network and filesystem. 
Since we focus on system performance bandwidth, we execute 42 
stressors for CPU, CPU cache, memory and virtual memory stressors 
(@Tbl:stressng-categories shows the list of stressors used in this 
paper). A _stressor_ (or microbenchmark) is a function that loops for 
a fixed amount of time, exercising a particular subcomponent of the 
system. At the end of its execution, `stress-ng` reports the rate of 
iterations executed for the specified period of time (referred to as 
`bogo-ops-per-second`).

computers in our lab. \label{tbl:machines}

![Boxplots illustrating the variability of the performance vector 
dataset. The data is normalized in order to guard against 
dimensionality issues. Thus, the y-axis shows variability in terms of 
the z-score (signed value representing the number of standard 
deviations by which the value of an observation is below or above the 
mean). Each stressor was executed five times on each of the machines 
listed in @Tbl:machines.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/stressng_variability.pdf){#fig:stressng-variability}

Using this battery of stressors, we can obtain a performance profile 
of a machine (a performance vector). When this vector is compared 
against the one corresponding to another machine, we can quantify the 
difference in performance between the two at a per-stressor level. 
@Fig:stressng-variability shows the variability in these performance 
vectors. We have significant variability coming from the hardware 
differences of the underlying nodes. As mentioned in @Sec:intuition, in contrast to what one might expect, we prefer higher variability since, as we will show later, the higher the variability among performance between machines, the more information the prediction models have available to identify the underlying system characteristics that affect application performance.

Every stressor (element in the vector) can be mapped to basic features 
of the underlying platform. For example, `bigheap` is directly 
associated to memory bandwidth, `zero` to memory mapping, `qsort` to 
CPU performance (in particular to sorting data), and so on and so 
forth. However, the performance of a stressor in this set is _not_ 
completely orthogonal to the rest, as implied by the overlapping 
categories in @Tbl:stressng-categories. @Fig:corrmatrix shows a 
heat-map of Pearson correlation coefficients for performance vectors 
obtained by executing `stress-ng` on all the distinct machine 
configurations available in CloudLab [@ricci_introducing_2014] 
(@Tbl:machines shows a summary of their hardware specs). As the figure 
shows, some stressors are slightly correlated (those near 0) while 
others show high correlation between them.

![Heat-map of Pearson correlation coefficients for performance vectors 
obtained by executing `stress-ng` on all the distinct machine 
configurations available in CloudLab.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/corrmatrix.pdf){#fig:corrmatrix}

In order to analyze this last point further, that is, to try to 
discern whether there are a few orthogonal features that we could 
focus on, rather than looking at the totality of the 42 stressors, we 
applied principal component decomposition (PCA) 
[@wold_principal_1987a]. @Fig:pca shows 
the relative (blue) and cumulative (green) explained variance ratio. The explained variance ratio is the amount of variability that a component removes from the dataset. The higher the variance associated to a component, the more the data can be explained by that component. 
Having 6-8 components would be enough to explain most 
of the variability in the dataset. This confirms what we observe in 
@Fig:corrmatrix, in terms of having many stressors that can be 
explained in function of others. So the reader might wonder, why not remove stressors in order to simplify the analysis? If we use the correlation matrix, we would need to define an arbitrary correlation index threshold. If we use PCA, we lose information with respect to what stressors are explaining a 
prediction. Instead of trying to reduce the number of features, we decide to leave 
all the stressors in order to not lose any information or having to define arbitrary thresholds. Part of our 
future work is to address whether we can reduce the number of features 
with the goal of improving the models, without having to lose 
information about which stressors are involved in the prediction.

![Principal Component Analysis for the performance vector dataset. The 
y-axis (log-scale) corresponds to the explained variance ratio, while 
the x-axis denotes the number of components. The blue line denotes the 
amount of variance reduced by having a particular number of 
components. The green line corresponds to the cumulative sum of the 
explained variance. We omit the last point due to space constraints, but we note that the variability at this point, while relatively (in the image), numerically is insignificant (y-axis is in log-scale).

## System Resource Utilization Via Feature Importance in SRA {#sec:feature-importance}

SRA is an approach for modeling the relationship between variables, 
usually corresponding to observed data points 
[@freedman_statistical_2009]. One or more independent variables are 
used to obtain a _regression function_ that explains the values taken 
by a dependent variable. A common approach is to assume a _linear 
predictor function_ and estimate the unknown parameters of the modeled 
relationships.

A large number of procedures have been developed for parameter 
estimation and inference in linear regression. These methods differ in 
computational simplicity of algorithms, presence of a closed-form 
solution, robustness with respect to heavy-tailed distributions, and 
theoretical assumptions needed to validate desirable statistical 
properties such as consistency and asymptotic efficiency. Some of the 
more common estimation techniques for linear regression are 
least-squares, maximum-likelihood estimation, among others.

`scikit-learn` [@pedregosa_scikitlearn_2011] provides many of the 
previously mentioned techniques for building regression models. 
Another technique available in `scikit-learn` is gradient boosting 
[@prettenhofer_gradient_2014]. Gradient boosting is a machine learning 
technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a 
prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, 
typically decision trees [@friedman_greedy_2001]. It builds the model 
in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it 
generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary 
differentiable loss function. This function is then optimized over a 
function space by iteratively choosing a function (weak hypothesis) 
that points in the negative gradient direction.

Once an ensemble of trees for an application is generated, feature 
importances are obtained in order to use them as the IRUP for an 
application. @Fig:irup-generation shows the process applied to 
obtaining IRUPs for an application. `scikit-learn` implements the 
feature importance calculation algorithm introduced in 
[@breiman_classification_1984] and is sketched in the following 
pseudo-code algorithm. Given an ensemble of trees:

 1. Initialize an `f_importance` array to hold a score for each 
    feature in the dataset.

 2. Take an unseen tree of the ensemble and traverse it using the 
    following steps:

     a. For each node that splits on feature $i$, compute the error 
        reduction of that node, multiplied by the number of samples 
        that were routed to the node.

     b. Add this quantity to the `f_importance` array (value 
        corresponding to feature $i$).

     c. Once all nodes are traversed, pick another unseen tree from 
        the ensemble and go to 2.

 3. Assign a score of 100 to the most important feature and normalize 
    the rest of elements in the `f_importance` array with respect to 
    this one.

For step 2.a, the error reduction is recursively defined by obtaining 
the difference between the parent node impurity and the weighted sum 
of the two child node impurities. The impurity criterion depends on 
whether the problem is a classification or regression one. Gini or MSE 
(among many others) can be used for classification. For regression, 
variance impurity is employed and corresponds to the variance of all 
data points that are routed through that node.

We note that before generating a regression model, we normalize the 
data by obtaining the z-score of the dataset. Given that the `bogo-ops-per-second` metric does not 
quantify work consistently across stressors, we normalize the data in 
order to prevent some features from dominating in the process of 
creating the prediction models. In @Sec:eval we evaluate 
the effectiveness of IRUPs.

## Using IRUPs in Automated Regression Tests {#sec:compare-irups}

As shown in @Fig:pipeline (step 4), when trying to determine whether a 
performance degradation occurred, IRUPs can be used to compare 
differences between current and past versions of an application. In 
order to do so, we apply a simple algorithm. Given two profiles $A$ 
and $B$, look at first feature in 
the ranking (highest in the chart). Then, compare the relative 
importance value for the feature and importance values for $A$ and 
$B$. If relative importance does not have the same value, the 
importance is considered not equivalent and the algorithm stops. If 
values are similar, we move to the next, less 
important factor and the compare again. This is repeated for as many 
features are present in the dataset.

IRUPs can also be used as a pointer to where to start with an 
investigation that looks for the root cause of the regression 
(@Fig:pipeline, step 5). For example, if the _stream_ stressor (mimics the STREAM benchmark [@mccalpin_memory_1995]) ends up being the 
most important feature, then we can start by looking at any 
code/libraries that make use of this subcomponent of the system. An 
analyst could also trace an application by capturing performance 
counters over time and look at corresponding counters to see which 
code paths make heavy use of the subcomponent in question.

## Effectiveness of IRUPs to Capture Resource Utilization Behavior {#sec:effective-irups}

In this subsection we show how IRUPs can effectively describe the 
fine granularity resource utilization of an application with respect 
to a set of machines. Our methodology is:

  1. Given an application $A$, discover relevant performance features 
     using the _quiho_ framework.
  2. Do manual performance analysis of $A$ to corroborate that 
     discovered features are indeed the cause of performance 
     differences.

@Fig:hpccg-irup shows the profile of an execution of the `hpccg` 
miniapp [@heroux_hpccg_2007]. This proxy application (or miniapp) 
[@heroux_improving_2009] is a "conjugate gradient benchmark code for a 
3D chimney domain on an arbitrary number of processors [that] 
generates a 27-point finite difference matrix with a user-prescribed 
sub-block size on each processor." [@heroux_hpccg_2007].

Based on the profile, `stackmmap` and `cache` are the most important 
features. In order to corroborate if this matches with what the 
application does, we profiled this execution with `perf`. The stacked 
profile view shows that ~85% of the time the application is running 
the function `HPC_sparsemv()`. The code for this function is shown in 
@Lst:hpccg-src. As the name implies, this snippet implements a sparse 
vector multiplication function of the form $y=Ax$ where $A$ is a 
sparse matrix and the $x$ and $y$ vectors are dense. By looking at 
this code, we see that the innermost loop iterates an array, 
accumulating the sum of a multiplication. This type of code is a 
potential candidate for manifesting bottlenecks associated with CPU 
cache locality [@akbudak_hypergraph_2013].

```{#lst:hpccg-src .c caption="Source code for bottleneck function in HPCCG."}
int HPC_sparsemv(HPC_Sparse_Matrix *A,
                 const double * const x,
                 double * const y)
{

  const int nrow = (const int) A->local_nrow;

  for (int i=0; i< nrow; i++) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    const double * const cur_vals = 
     (const double * const) A->ptr_to_vals_in_row[i];

    const int    * const cur_inds = 
     (const int    * const) A->ptr_to_inds_in_row[i];

    const int cur_nnz = (const int) A->nnz_in_row[i];

    for (int j=0; j< cur_nnz; j++)
        sum += cur_vals[j]*x[cur_inds[j]];
    y[i] = sum;
  }

  return(0);
}
```

\begin{table}\caption{
Table of performance counters for the HPCCG performance test.
\label{tbl:perf-counters}
}
\footnotesize
\input{figures/perf-counters.tex}
\end{table}

We analyze the performance of this benchmark further by obtaining 
performance counters for the application and comparing the counters 
with those from the top three features (@Tbl:perf-counters shows the 
summary of hardware-level performance counters). Given that hardware 
performance counters are architecture-dependent, we can not make 
generalizations about given that we run an application on a multitude 
of machines. Having said this, we can try to analyze the counter results for the particular machine where we ran this test. We can see that the performance counters values for the `hpccg` 
application correspond to a combination of values for the three most 
relevant features (stressors). In the case of the `stackmmap` 
stressor, similarities between stalled cycle counters are noticeable 
denoting similarities in stalled cycles, which are associated to 
application performance [@cepeda_pipeline_2011 ; 
@mcnairy_itanium_2003].

Next, we analyze the IRUPs of other three applications[^brevity]. 
These applications are Redis [@zawodny_redis_2009], Scikit-learn 
[@pedregosa_scikitlearn_2011], and SSCA [@bader_design_2005]. Due to 
space constraints we omit a similar detailed analysis as the one 
presented above for `hpccg`. However, resource utilization 
characteristics of these code bases is well known and we verify IRUPs 
using this knowledge. As a way of illustrating the 
performance variability of these applications on an 
heterogeneous set of machines, @Fig:variability shows boxplots of their runtime.

![Variability of the four applications presented in this subsection. 
Y-axis has been normalized.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/apps_variability.pdf){#fig:variability}

In @Fig:others we show IRUPs for these four applications[^top5]. The first 
two on the top correspond to two tests of Redis, a popular open-source 
in-memory key-value database. These two tests are `SET`, `GET` from 
the `redis-benchmark` command that test operations that store and 
retrieve key-value pairs into/from the DB, respectively. The resource 
utilization profiles suggest that `SET` and `GET` are memory intensive 
operations (first 3 stressors from each test, as shown in 
@Tbl:stressng-categories), which is an obvious conclusion. 

[^top5]: In order to enhance the visualization of the IRUPs we only 
show the top 5 most important features. Complete profiles can be 
visualized on the Jupyter notebook contained in the github repository.

![IRUPs for the four tests benchmarked in this section. This and subsequent figures show only the top 5 most important features in order to improve visualization of the plots.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/four.pdf){#fig:others}

The next two IRUPs (below) correspond to performance tests for 
Scikit-learn and SSCA. In the case of Scikit-learn, this test runs a 
comparison of several classifiers in on a synthetic dataset. 
Scikit-learn uses NumPy [@walt_numpy_2011] internally, which is known 
to be memory-bound. The profile is aligned to this known behavior 
since the `zero` microbenchmark stresses access.

The last application is SSCA, a graph analysis benchmark comprising of 
a data generator and 4 kernels which operate on the graph. The 
benchmark is designed to have very little locality, which causes the 
application to generate a many cache misses. As shown in the profile, 
the first feature corresponds to the `cache` stressor, which as it was 
explained earlier, stresses the CPU cache by generating a non-locality 
workload.

[^brevity]: For brevity, we omit other results that corroborate IRUPs 
can correctly identify resource utilization patterns. All these are 
available in the Github repository accompanying this article.

## Simulating Regressions {#sec:irups-for-simulated}

In this section we test the effectiveness of _quiho_ to detect 
performance simulations that are artificially induced. We induce 
regression by having a set of performance tests that take, as input, 
parameters that determine their performance behavior, thus simulating 
different "versions" of the same application. In total, we have 10 
benchmarks for which we can induce several performance regressions, 
for a total of 20 performance regressions. For brevity, in this 
section we present results for two applications, MariaDB 
[@widenius_mariadb_2009] and a modified version of the STREAM 
benchmark.

The MariaDB test is based on the `mysqlslap` utility for stressing the 
database engine. In our case we run the data loading test, which populates a 
database whose schema is specified by the user. We have a 
fixed set of parameters that load a 10GB database. One of the exposed 
parameters is the one that selects the backend (storage engine in 
MySQL terminology). While the workload and test parameters are the 
same, the code paths are distinct and thus present different 
performance characteristics. The two engines we use in this case are 
`innodb` and `memory`. @Fig:mariadb-innodb-vs-memory shows the 
profiles of MariaDB performance for these two engines.

![MariaDB with innodb and in-memory backends.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/mariadb-innodb-vs-memory.pdf){#fig:mariadb-innodb-vs-memory}

The next test is a modified version of the STREAM benchmark 
[@mccalpin_memory_1995], which we refer to as STREAM-NADDS (introduced 
in [@hutcheson_memory_2011]). This version of STREAM introduces a 
`NADDS` pre-processor parameter that controls the number additions for 
the `Add` test of the STREAM benchmark. In terms of the code, when 
`NADDS` equals to 1 is equivalent to the "vanilla" STREAM benchmark. 
For any value greater than 1, the code adds a new term to the sum 
being executed. Intuitively, since the vanilla version of STREAM is 
memory bound, so adding more terms to the sum causes the CPU to do 
more work, eventually moving the bottleneck from memory to being 
cpu-bound; the higher the value of the `NADDS` parameter, the more 
cpu-bound the test gets. @Fig:stream-adds shows this behavior.

![General behavior of the STREAM-NADDS performance test. The y-axis is 
the throughput of the test in MB/s. The x-axis corresponds to the 
number of terms in the sum expression of the `Add` STREAM subtest. The 
regular ("vanilla") STREAM add test is memory bound, so adding more 
terms to the `Add` subtest moves the performance from memory- to 
cpu-bound; the higher the value of the `NADDS` parameter, the more 
CPU-bound the test gets. This test was executed across all available 
machines (5 times). The bars denote standard deviation.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/stream-nadds-behavior.pdf){#fig:stream-adds}

@Fig:stream-irups shows the IRUPs for the four tests. On the left, 
we see the resource utilization behavior of the "vanilla" version of 
STREAM (which corresponds to a value of 1 for the `NADDS` parameter). 
As expected, the associated features (stressors) to these are from the 
memory/VM category, in particular `vecmath`. As the number of terms 
for the sum increases, the test moves all the way to being CPU-bound 
(at `NADDS=30`), which can be seen by observing the `bsearch` and 
`hsearch` features going up in importance as the number of additions 
increases.

![The IRUPs for modified version of STREAM. The parameter of `NADDS` 
increases by taking values of 1, 2, 4, ..., 20 and 30. We see that 
they capture the simulated regression which causes this application to 
be moving from being memory-bound to being cpu-bound.

## Real world Scenario {#sec:irups-for-real}

In this section we show that _quiho_ works with regressions that can 
be found in real software projects. It is documented that the changes 
made to the `innodb` storage engine in version 10.3.2 improves the 
performance in MariaDB, with respect to previous version 5.5.58. If we 
take the development timeline and invert it, we can treat 5.5.58 as if 
it was a "new" revision that introduces a performance regression. To 
show that this can be captured with IRUPs, we use `mysqlslap` again 
and run the `load` test. @Fig:mariadb-innodb-regression shows the 
corresponding IRUPs. We can observe that the IRUP generated by _quiho_ 
can identify the difference in performance. For brevity, we omit 
regressions found in other 4 applications (zlog, postgres, redis, and 
apache web server).

![A regression that appears from going in the reversed timeline (from 
mariadb-10.0.3 to 5.5.38).

# Discussion {#sec:discussion}

In this section we provide a high-level discussion on several aspects of _quiho_.

**Application-Independent Performance Characterization**. The main 
advantage of the _quiho_ approach is its resiliency. By inferring 
resource utilization instead of directly instrumenting code to 
generate profiles, the _quiho_ approach is resilient to code 
refactoring and requires no manual intervention. We used a subset of 
`stress-ng` microbenchmarks to quantify machine performance but the 
approach is not limited to this benchmarking toolkit. Ideally, we 
would like to extend the amount and type of stressors so that we have 
more coverage over the distinct subcomponents of a system. An open 
question is to systematically test whether the current set of 
stressors is sufficient to cover all subcomponents of a system, and at 
the same time reduce the number of microbenchmarks.

**Falsifiability of IRUPs** The reader might have noticed that, regardless of how the performance 
of an application looks like, SRA will always produce a model with 
associated feature importances. Thus, one can pose the following 
question: is there any scenario where an IRUP is _not_ correctly 
associated with what the application is doing? In other words, are 
IRUPs falsifiable? The answer is yes. An IRUP can be incorrectly 
representing an application's performance behavior if there is under- 
or over-fitting when generating the model. @Fig:corrmatrix_underfit shows 
the correlation matrix obtained from a dataset containing only 3 data 
points (generated by selecting two random machines from the set of 
available ones). Almost all stressors are highly correlated among each 
other, which suggests (as explained in @Sec:quiho) there is little 
that a prediction model can learn about the underlying resource 
utilization behavior of an application in this dataset (which contains 
only a couple of points, coming from two machines with very similar 
characteristics). This is confirmed by obtaining an IRUP multiple 
times for an application contained in this small dataset 
(@Fig:redis-set_underfit). The application in this case is 
`redis-set`. If we obtain the IRUP 3 times and compare them, we 
observe that they give completely random and contradictory results 
(for example, the bottom IRUP ranks CPU stressors as the top important 
features). This is in contrast to what we observe with well-fitted 
models, such as the ones in @Fig:others for which  multiple IRUPs show 
consistent results in their results.
The correlation matrix shows why this is so: almost all 
the features are highly correlated. One way of determining the right 
amount of machines needed in order to generate good models is to apply 
probable aproximate correct learning (PAC) [@valiant_theory_1984] to 
this dataset in order to quantify the probability of obtaining highly 
accurate estimations.

machines from @Tbl:machines.

the same dataset, which consistes of only two randomly selected 
machines from @Tbl:machines.
](pipelines/single-node/results/figures/redis-set_underfit.pdf){#fig:redis-set_underfit}

**Quiho vs. other tools**. The main advantage of _quiho_ over other 
performance profiling tools is that it is automatic and 100% 
hands-off. As mentioned before, the main assumption being that there 
exist performance vectors (or they are obtained as part of the test) 
for a sufficiently varied set of machines. We see _quiho_ as a 
complement, not a replacement of `perf`, to existing performance 
engineering practices: once a test has failed _quiho_'s checks, then 
proceed to make use of existing tools.

**IRUP Comparison**. The algorithm specified in @Sec:compare-irups 
is a straight-forward one. One could think of more sophisticated ways 
of doing IRUP comparison and finding equivalences. For example, using 
the categories from @Tbl:stressng-categories, one could try to group 
stressors and determine coarse-grained bottlenecks, instead of fine 
grained ones. Another alternative is to do reduce the number of 
features by applying PCA, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), or 
singular value decomposition (SVD), and compare profiles in terms of 
the mapped factors.

**IRUP as a visualization tool**. The reader might have noticed that 
IRUPs can be visually compared by the human eye (and are somewhat 
similar in this regard to FlameGraphs [@gregg_flame_2016]). Adding a 
coloring scheme to IRUPs might make it easier to interpret the 
differences. For example, the categories in @Tbl:stressng-categories 
could be used to define a color palette (by assigning a color to each 
subset of the powerset of categories).

**Reproducibility**. Providing performance vectors alongside 
experimental results allows to preserve information about the 
performance characteristics of the underlying system that an 
experiment observed at the time it ran. This is a quantifiable 
snapshot that provides context and facilitates the interpretation of 
results. Ideally, this information could be used as input for 
emulators and virtual machines, in order to recreate original 
performance characteristics.

**Reinforcement Learning**. Over the course of its life, an application 
will be tested on many platforms. If we can have an ever-growing list 
of machines where an application is tested, the more we run an 
application in a scenario like this, the more rich the performance 
vector dataset (and associated application performance history). This 
can serve as the foundation to applycbecomes we learn about its 
properties. For example, if we had performance vectors captured as 
part of executions of the Phoronix benchmark suite (which has public 
data on <https://openbenchmarking.org>), we could leverage such a dataset to 
create rich performance models.

# Related Work {#sec:sra}

**Automated Regression Testing**. Automated regression testing 
[@perl_performance_1993] can be broken down in the following three 
steps. 1) In the case of large software projects, decide which tests 
to execute [@kazmi_effective_2017]. This line of work is complementary 
to _quiho_. 2) Once a test executes, decide whether a regression has 
occurred [@syer_continuous_2014]. This can be broken down in mainly 
two categories, as explained in [@shang_automated_2015]: pair-wise 
comparisons and model assisted. _quiho_ fits in the latter category, 
the main difference being that, as opposed to existing solutions, 
_quiho_ does not rely on having accurate prediction models since its 
goal is to describe resource utilization (obtain IRUPs). 3) If a 
regression is observed, automatically find the root cause or aid an 
analyst to find it [@ibidunmoye_performance_2015 ; 
@heger_automated_2013]. While _quiho_ does not 
find the root cause of regressions, it complements the information 
that an analyst has available to investigate further.

**Profiling-based Performance Modeling**. Modeling performance based 
on application profiles has been studied before 
[@snavely_modeling_2001 ; @ghaith_profilebased_2013a ; 
@shen_automating_2015]. In [@snavely_modeling_2001], the MAPS 
benchmark is used to characterize the performance of machines. These 
profiles are then convoluted with application traces obtained by the 
MetaSim tool in order to obtain a prediction on the performance of an 
application. In [@shen_automating_2015] the authors use randomized 
optimization (genetic algorithms) to systematically explore the 
parameter space of an application in order to create a record of 
`<input, runtime>` pairs. _quiho_ can be used in this case to augment 
the available information and have an IRUP associated to the inputs of 
the application under study.

**Performance Profile Visualization**. An IRUP can be used to 
visualize performance and thus have a resemblance with a flame graph 
[@gregg_flame_2016]. In [@bezemer_understanding_2015] the authors 
introduce the concept of differential flame grahps, which can be used 
to visually compare the changes between two or more flame graphs. A 
similar approach could be applied to IRUPs in order to visualize the 
differences between two flame graphs.

**Inducing Performance Regressions**. In [@chen_exploratory_2017], the 
authors analyzed the code repositories of two open source projects in 
order to device a way of systematically inducing performance 
regressions. Our methodology instruments an application in order to 
parametrize performance and control when changes in performance are 
triggered, as a way of testing methods that are aimed at detecting 
these changes.

**Decision Trees In Performance Engineering**. In 
[@jung_detecting_2006] the authors use decision trees to detect 
anomalies and predict performance SLO violations. They validate their 
approach using a TPC-W workload in a multi-tiered setting. In 
[@shang_automated_2015], the authors use performance counters to build 
a regression model aimed at filtering out irrelevant performance 
counters. In [@nguyen_automated_2012a], the approach is similar but 
statistical process control techniques are employed instead. In the 
case of _quiho_, the goal is to use decision trees as a way of 
obtaining feature performance, thus, as opposed to what it's proposed 
in [@shang_automated_2015], the leaves of the generated decision trees 
contain actual performance predictions instead of the name of 
performance counters

**Correlation-based Analysis and Supervised Learning**. Correlation 
and supervised learning approaches have been proposed in the context 
of software testing, mainly for detecting anomalies in application 
performance [@ibidunmoye_performance_2015]. In the former, runtime 
performance metrics are correlated to application performance using a 
variety of distinct metrics. In supervised learning, the goal is the 
same (build prediction models) but using labeled datasets. Decision 
trees are a form of supervised learning, however, given that _quiho_ 
applies regression rather than classification techniques, it does not 
rely on labeled datasets. Lastly, _quiho_ is not intended to be used 
as a way of detecting anomalies, although we have not analyzed its 
potential use in this scenario.

# Future Work {#sec:conclusion}

The main limitation in _quiho_ is the requirement of having to execute 
a test on more than one machine in order to obtain IRUPs. On the other 
hand, we can avoid having to run `stress-ng` every time the 
application gets tested by integrating this into the infrastructure 
(e.g., system administrators can run `stress-ng` once a day or once a 
week and make this information for every machine available to users).

We are currently working in adapting this approach to profile 
distributed and multi-tiered applications. We also plan to analyze the 
viability of applying _quiho_ in multi-tenant configurations and to 
profile long-running (multi-stage) applications such as a web-service 
or big-data applications. In these cases, we would define windows of 
time and apply _quiho_ to each. The main challenge in this scenario is 
to automatically define the windows in such a way that we can get 
accurate profiles.

In the era of cloud computing, even the most basic computer systems 
are complex multi-layered pieces of software, whose performance 
properties are difficult to comprehend. Having complete understanding 
of the performance behavior of an application, considering the 
parameter space (workloads, multi-tenancy, etc.) is challenging. One 
application of _quiho_ we have in mind is to couple it with automated 
black-box (or even gray-box) testing frameworks to improve our 
understanding of complex systems.
